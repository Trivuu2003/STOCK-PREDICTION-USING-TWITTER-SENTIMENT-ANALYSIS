# STOCK-PREDICTION-USING-TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS
Our project is structured into nine stages: collecting stock data, scraping Twitter data, preprocessing tweets, and performing sentiment analysis â€”ARIMA as a baseline and a deep learning model using 1D-CNN and BiCudaLSTM layers. The models are compared to evaluate the strengths of the proposed deep learning method over ARIMA. Finally, the deep learning approach is tested on real-time data to assess its accuracy and adaptability.
By combining sentiment analysis with deep learning, our approach aims to provide more robust and accurate predictions, addressing the complexities of stock market behavior and outperforming traditional methods like ARIMA.
